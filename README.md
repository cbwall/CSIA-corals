# Amino acid compound specific isotope analyses (AA-CSIA) of reef corals
*Wall CB, Wallsgrove NJ, Gates RD, Popp BN. 20201. Amino acid δ13C and δ15N analyses reveal distinct species-specific patterns of trophic plasticity in a marine symbiosis. Limnology and Oceanography*  

Compound specific isotope analyses (CSIA) and multivariate ‘isotope fingerprinting’ track biosynthetic sources and reveal trophic interactions in food webs. However, CSIA have not been widely applied in the study of marine symbioses. Here, we exposed a reef coral (Montipora capitata) in symbiosis with Symbiodiniaceae algae to experimental treatments (autotrophy, mixotrophy, heterotrophy) to test for trophic shifts and amino acid (AA) sources using paired bulk (δ13C, δ15N) and AA-CSIA (δ13CAA, δ15NAA).
